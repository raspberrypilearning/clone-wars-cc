## Challenge: lives and score

At the moment, you can play the game forever, but it doesn't count how many hippos you shoot or how many times your spaceship explodes.

Can you add `lives`{:class="block3variables"}, a `score`{:class="block3variables"}, or even a `highscore`{:class="block3variables"} to your game?
